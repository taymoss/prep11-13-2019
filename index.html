    <h1>11/14 Prep - Animation</h1>
    <p>
    In order for us to be able to do the wonderful things that Dr.B displayed in class on Tuesday, we need to do a couple things that aren't really that difficult. The animations are done with a hover, the same that can be found in CSS. Luckily, the browsers we use today also support the newest edition of CSS, CCS3, that has simple transitions baked into it. The simple transitions are a smooth transitions over an interval that you select.You can also go more in depth and create and change these transitions using JavaScript and D3. Instead of hover, you can use the 
    'mouseover' function to recreate a CSS hover.

    <p>
    The code to create this within CSS would look something like this:
    </p>
    rect:hover {                     this tells the rectangle to do when being hovered over
    <p>
    <p>
    fill: orange;                     this tells it to fill it with orange when hovered over
    </p>
    <p>
    }
    </p>
    <p>
    rect {                   this gives the transitions for each browser to the rectangle
    </p>
    <p>
    -moz-transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    -o-transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    -webkit-transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    transition: all 0.5s;
    </p>
    <p>
    }
    </p>
      <p>
      And that is how we create a cool visual like Dr.B.
